This package contains the imgtops and epstoimg utilities.  This is
version 1.0; you should always be able to find the latest version at

  http://imgtops.sourceforge.net/

imgtops converts a wide variety of bitmap image formats (jpg, png,
gif, tif, bmp, and others) into Encapsulated PostScript documents,
using PostScript languagelevel 2 and 3 features to minimize the size
of the resulting output files.

epstoimg uses the free Ghostscript interpreter to produce bitmap
images from PostScript source files.  Either PS or EPS files may be
used as input; the "e" in the program name is to avoid a conflict with
another, similar utility.

Both programs require:

 - Python 2.2 or higher -- http://www.python.org/
 - the Python Imaging Library -- http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/

epstoimg also requires:

 - Ghostscript -- http://www.ghostscript.com/

 


INSTALLATION
------------

Start the installation by typing:

   python setup.py install

and follow the prompts.  If you don't have a C compiler, you
can install a pure Python implementation by typing:

   python setup-pure.py install

instead.  The pure version of imgtops can be significantly slower,
depending on the image and options selected.  (epstoimg is
unaffected.)

Once installed, the imgtops and epstoimg man pages give instructions
on using the programs.
