version 1.0    :  4 Sep 2003

   PIL's handling of paletted images changed in version 1.1.4; imgtops
   now handles both the new and older versions.  Haven't run across
   any major bugs since March, so we'll call it 1.0!
	
version 0.9.2  :  24 Mar 2003

   imgtops handles most PIL image modes via conversion.  (Notably,
   RGBA images are handled by dropping the alpha channel.)

   ASCII data line lengths are limited to 75 characters by default.
   Added -n option to change this.

   Level 3 output files will now print on level 2 devices, but they
   will show a grey box and a numeral '3' in place of the image.

version 0.9.1  :   2 Mar 2003

   Added rotation option to epstoimg.  Changed short form of
   "resolution" option to "-s".

version 0.9    :  22 Feb 2003

   First released version.
